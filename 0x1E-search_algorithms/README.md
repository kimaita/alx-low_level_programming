# Search Algorithms

A [search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm) is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.  

Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing.

- _Linear search_ algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.
- _Binary_, or _half-interval_, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.
- _Comparison search_ algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.
- _Digital search_ algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys.
- _Hashing_ directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.
