# Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are algorithms designed to solve a search problem - work to retrieve information stored within a particular data structure.

Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into:

- [Linear](#linear-search)
- [Binary](#binary-search)

## Linear Search

Linear search algorithms check every record in the data structure for the  target in a linear fashion.  
[Implementation](./0-linear.c)

## Binary Search

Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. This works best for ordered data.  
[Implementation](./1-binary.c)
