# Bit Manipulation

## Number system conversions

* [Binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10)](./0-binary_to_uint.c)
  
## Bit-wise operations

* `AND` (`&`) -
  Performs bitwise AND for a set of bits. For each pair of bits, returns 1 for both bits set or 0 otherwise
* `OR` (`|`) -
  Performs bitwise OR for a set of bits. For each pair of bits, returns 1 if either bit is set or 0 otherwise
* `NOT` (`~`) -
  Performs bitwise NOT for a set of bits. For each bit, returns the inverse i.e. 0 for 1 and 1 for 0
* `XOR` (`^`) -
  Performs bitwise XOR for a set of bits. For each pair of bits, returns 0 for both bits set/unset or 1 otherwise
* Right Shift (`>>`) -
  Shifts a binary number a given number of bits to the right
* Left Shift (`<<`) -
  Shifts a binary number a given number of bits to the left
