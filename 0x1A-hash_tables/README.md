# C - Hash tables

**[Hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)** are abstract data structures that implement an associative array/dictionary/map i.e a `key:value` pairing of data. A key is generated for each value and is then used as an index for the value in the hashtable(array). This key is used for insertions and lookups, providing Î˜(1) time complexity.

**[Hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)** are used to generate the key for a value. A singular hash function is used for an instance of a hashtable and should _ideally_ produce hash codes(keys) that are unique for each value, but this isn't always the case.  

**[Collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision)** occur when two values produce the same key for a given hash function meaning that they would map to the same index in the hash table. There is thus a need for a mechanisms to handle these collisions.  

**[Chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining)** is a method for resolving collisions by storing data that maps to the same index in a linked list at that index, instead of the singular value. Accessing the value would then be a two-step process of computing and accessing the index, then traversing the linked list to find the data.

## Implementation

* [hash_tables](./hash_tables.h) defines the structure of our hash table and it's nodes.  
The hash table, `hash_table_s`, consists of an integer `size` defining its size and an array of pointers to nodes `array`.  
The nodes, `hash_node_s`, consist of a `key`(character array), `value`(character array) and pointer `next` pointing to the next node.
* [hash_table_create](./0-hash_table_create.c) creates a hashtable of given size
* [djb2](./1-djb2.c) is the provided hashing algorithm. [Source](https://gist.github.com/papamuziko/7bb52dfbb859fdffc4bd0f95b76f71e8)
